title: Hello world

What started as a weekend project whose only goals where to showcase the ease of use of [QCodeEdit](http://qcodeedit.org)
and take my mind of that pesky internship report is starting to take a life of its own.

As the homepage says, RotiDeCode is a trimmed-down text editor. Funny how the wheel turns: QCodeEdit was a spin-off of the
now-defunct [Edyuk](http://edyuk.org) and a few years later I find myself writing a new text editor to push myself to do a
more thorough job at packaging and documentation as well as to ensure that the API I've come up with actually makes sense.

Although RotiDeCode is intended to be usable and reliable, it is also very much a playground for me, and possibly for other
people that share my interest in exploring the text editing landscape. With that in mind, I decided to release the sources
under the FreeBSD license (2-clause BSD aka "Simplified BSD").

I still have relatively little time to invest in side projects but I'm hopeful that having a more visible/usable result
that I can (Soon&trade;) use on a daily basis will significantly boost my motivation and productivity.
